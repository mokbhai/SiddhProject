## Usage Options

### 🚀 Quick Start - Interactive CLI (Recommended)

The easiest way to use the UI testing workflow is through the interactive CLI:

```bash
# Start interactive CLI
npm run ui-test

# Or use the launcher directly
node src/uiTesting/run-cli.js
```

This will open an interactive prompt where you can:

- Enter testing prompts directly
- Use predefined examples
- Get help and guidance
- See colored output for better UX

### 📝 Command Line Arguments

You can also pass prompts directly as arguments:

```bash
# Direct prompt
npm run ui-test "Test the UI of https://github.com - focus on navigation and search"

# Show examples
npm run ui-test --examples

# Show help
npm run ui-test --help
```

### 🔧 Programmatic Usage

For integration into other tools or scripts:

```typescript
import { runUITesting } from "./src/uiTesting";

// Run UI testing with URL and instructions
await runUITesting(
  "Test the user interface of https://example.com - focus on navigation and form interactions"
);
```

## Interactive CLI Features

### 🎯 Smart Commands

The CLI supports several commands for enhanced usability:

- `!examples` - Show predefined example prompts
- `!help` - Display detailed help information
- `!clear` - Clear the screen
- `!quit` or `!exit` - Exit the CLI
- `1-5` - Select numbered examples directly

### 💡 Example Prompts

The CLI includes predefined examples for common testing scenarios:

1. **GitHub Repository Testing**

   ```
   Test the user interface and navigation of https://github.com - focus on repository browsing, search functionality, and user profile pages
